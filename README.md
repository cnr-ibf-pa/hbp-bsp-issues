# hbp-bsp-issues
Ticketing system for developers/testers and power users of the Brain Simulation Platform of the Human Brain Project 

# Usage
1. Give a **concise description** of your issue including the 'what' and 'why'.
2. In the ticket itself please **provide all sufficient information** so the issue can be dealt with promptly. Please add screenshots when it makes sense.
3. If the problem is really urgent, you can add the **Urgent** label. 
4. Select a yellow **issue-type label** to determine if your issue is a bug or a feature request.
5. Select a green **use case label** to specify the use case your issue belongs to

# Features

## Labels

The labels are thought to organize the issues. The definition can be changed/extended when it makes sense. The labels of the same color are prefixed with the same prefix, so they appear together in the alphabetical order. There are three label groups:

### Red: Urgent 

To label issues when they are really urgent (and only then...)

### Yellow: Issue type

Is the issue a bug or a feature request?

### Green: Use case group

To determine what use case group the ticke belongs to. Only to be used if no 'blue' classification fits.

### Blue: Use Case

To determine what use case the ticke belongs to

## Milestones

Milestones are used to prioritize the issues. Major milestones contain the month as due date. There are two other milestones to collect issues which are not yet assigned to a major milestone

### SGA2

Every task that is scheduled for SGA2

### Next Tasks

Important tasks that will be worked on in a milestone soon.

### Minor Tasks

Less important tasks that will be worked on at a later time.

## References

Whenever it seems reasonable, use the reference feature to reference another issue (with a hash: \#<number>, e.g. \#12)
  
## Mentions

Whenever it seems reasonable, use the mentions feature to reference another issue (\@<number>, e.g. \@alex4200)

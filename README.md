# hbp-bsp-issues
Ticketing system for developers/testers and power users of the Brain Simulation Platform of the Human Brain Project 

# Usage
1. When opening a ticket select one of the four templates: **Bug or Issue**, **New Feature**, **New Use Case** or **Simple Task**.
2. Fill out the template and be **as precise as possible** to avoid confusion or later time-consuming clarifications. **Provide all sufficient information** so the issue can be dealt with promptly. Please add screenshots when it makes sense.
3. Always add a **yellow** label (to identify the type of ticket) and a **green** label (to define the scope/use case). 
3. If the task is urgent or important, you can add the **Critical** label or the **High** label. 

# Features

## Labels

The labels are thought to organize the issues. The definition can be changed/extended when it makes sense. The labels of the same color are prefixed with the same prefix, so they appear together in the alphabetical order. There are three label groups:

### Red: Urgent and Blocker and High

To label tickets which are reakky urgent (or are a blocking task)

### Yellow: Issue type

Is the issue a bug or a feature request?

### Green: Scope/Use case 

To determine what use case or scope the ticket belongs to. 

## Milestones

Milestones are used to prioritize the issues. Currently we use the SGA2 milestones (M6, M12, M18, M24),  

## References

Whenever it seems reasonable, use the reference feature to reference another issue (with a hash: \#<number>, e.g. \#12)
  
## Mentions

Whenever it seems reasonable, use the mentions feature to reference another issue (\@<number>, e.g. \@alex4200)
